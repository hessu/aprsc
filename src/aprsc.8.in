The

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B aprsc
has following runtime options:
.TP
.BI "\-t " chrootdir
Run the
.B aprsc
in a
.IR chroot (2)
subdirectory.
Use also the \-u option below.
.TP
.BI "\-u " setuid_username
When running the
.B aprsc
in
.IR chroot (2)
subdirectory, it should be running there with a non-privileged user account.
This option defines that account, which must be found at the system account database.
.TP
.BI "\-c " config_file_name
Define explicit configuration file name.
Default is "aprsc.conf" in current directory.
.TP
.BI "\-f"
.br
.IR fork (2)
the program ro tun in the background.
.TP
.BI "\-n " logname
Define a name by which
.I this
instance of the
.B aprsc
is known in the log.
Useful when you have multiple instances running.
.TP
.BI "\-r " log_dir
For file based logging, do it all in given directory.
There is no default log directory.
.TP
.BI "\-e " loglevel_token
The supported tokens are following with their corresponding priority values
.IR EMERG (0),
.IR ALERT (1),
.IR CRIT (2),
.IR ERROR (3),
.IR WARNING (4),
.IR NOTICE (5),
.IR INFO (6),
.IR DEBUG (7).
This option defines a logging cutoff where events with higher numeric value
than the given cutoff are dropped internally.
The default cutoff is
.IR INFO .
.TP
.BI "\-o " logdestination_token
The supported tokens are following:
.IR none ,
.IR stderr ,
.IR syslog ", and"
.IR file .
.PP
.SH LOGGING
The logging has multiple options:
.TP
.B none
.br
Disable logging completely
.TP
.B stderr
.br
Log to stderr of the running users console session
Do not use this when runtime option
.B "\-f"
is being used.
.TP
.B syslog
.br
Use
.IR syslog (3)
mechanism to send logging events to system
.IR syslogd (8),
When running under
.IR chroot (2)
this may require that the syslogd is configured to have log event receiving
named socket within that chroot area.
.TP
.B file
.br
The logging goes to configured directory using file names:
.IR aprsc.log ", and"
.IR aprsc.access.log .
which autorotate with up to N older versions,
each with M megabytes of size when the rotation happens.
Configuration of N and M is done with
.IR aprsc.conf (7).
