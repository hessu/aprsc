WorkerThreads 3

# When running this server as super-user, the server can (in many systems)
# increase several resource limits, and do other things that less privileged
# server can not do.
#
# The FileLimit is resource limit on how many simultaneous connections and
# some other internal resources the system can use at the same time.
# If the server is not being run as super-user, this setting has no effect.
#
FileLimit        10000
